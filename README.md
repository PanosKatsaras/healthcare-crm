# Healthcare CRM - Healthcare Management System

HealthCRM is a Full-Stack healthcare management system designed to streamline the management of appointments, patients, doctors, medical records, and examinations. 
Built with modern technologies, it provides a robust and scalable solution for healthcare organizations.

The system includes role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring that users—such as administrators, doctors, managers, and staff—have access only to the data and features relevant to their roles. 
This enhances security, privacy, and authorization, allowing for efficient and compliant healthcare management.
